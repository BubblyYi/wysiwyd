Learning:
•  run awareTouch in the console
•  touch the robot the way you want (say caress)
•  close awareTouch
•  the file ~./local/share/yarp/context/awareTouch/Touching.txt is created
•  rename it caress.txt
•   
•  Repeat the process for all the types of touch you want.
•  Edit the config.ini and change the gestureTypes property so that it is a list of the text files you just create, without the .txt extension

Using:
Simply run awareTouch and it will populate the opc with a relation of type (iCub, is, caress, touchLocation).
If you have access to the opcClient you can do :
list<Relation> tactileRelations = opc->getRelationsMatching("icub","is","any","touchLocation");
if (tactileRelations.size() > 0)
{
        cout<<"I am touched"<<endl;
        //Look at the place where it has been touched
        Object* touchLocation = (Object*) iCub->opc->getEntity("touchLocation");
}

Alternatively, the port /awareTouch/events:o streams out the event according to the following format: ("part-touched" "gesture-type") (x y z).
